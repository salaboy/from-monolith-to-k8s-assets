# From Monolith To K8s Assets
Files, Workflow Models and other resources needed for a [Workshop that you can find here](https://github.com/salaboy/from-monolith-to-k8s/blob/master/workshop.md)

- [C4P Orchestration with Notifications](https://github.com/salaboy/from-monolith-to-k8s-assets/blob/main/c4p-orchestration-with-notification.bpmn)

If you want to edit these models you can download the [Desktop Zeebe Modeler from here](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-modeler/releases) or you can open them in [bpmn.io](http://bpmn.io)
